# Description:
# The function calculates the shapes of the generalized or theta-sigmoid
# functional response (e.g., Real 1977; Okuyama & Ruyle 2011; Vucic-Pestic et
# al. 2010). See Kalinkat et al. (2023) and Rall et al. (2023) for details.
#
# Arguments:
# N:     The resource densities (positive vector)
# Fmax:  The maximum feeding rate (the curves' asymptote, single value)
# N0:    The half saturation rate (density at which Fmax is reached, single value)
# Theta: The shaping exponent (can be a vector). Theta = 1 is a type II functional
#            response. Theta > 1 is a sigmoid type III functional response. Most
#            studies use Theta = 2 for modeling a type III functional response.
# 
# Requirements:
# None
