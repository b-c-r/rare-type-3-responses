# Description:
# The function compiles the code for a 3-species food chain (Otto et al. 2007)
# with additional shaping exponent q (e.g. Williams and Martinez 2004). The
# model will be compiled in C using odeintr (Keitt 2017). Please read the
# methodology in the supplement to the paper by Kalinkat et al. (under
# review) and Williams and Martinez for model details. Please consult the help
# file of odeintr (?odeintr::compile_sys) for the use of this specific function.
#
# Model parameters:
# fmax1 / fmax2: The maximum feeding rate of the intermediate consumer and the 
#                top consumer, respsectively.
# N0: The half saturation density.
# q: The shaping exponent controlling the functional response shape
#    (0 = hyperbolic) and (0 > sigmoid).
# m1 / m2: The metabolic (loss) rate.
# e: The assimilation efficiency.
# x: The population biomass densities for the basal consumer (x[0]), the
#    intermediate consumer (x[1]), and the top consumer (x[2]).
#
# Arguments:
# none
# 
# Requirements:
# Needs the package odeintr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odeintr)
