# Description:
# The function creates Figure 1(A) from Kalinkat et al. (2023), see Rall et al.
# (2023) for methods.
#
# Arguments:
# N:           The resource densities (positive vector)
# Fmax:        The maximum feeding rate (the curves' asymptote, single value)
# a:           The attack rate (single value)
# ylims:       The limits of the y-axis
# output_path: The (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "FIG_OUT/")
# save_output: Logical (T/F). Should the output be saved as pdf?
# 
# Requirements:
# None
