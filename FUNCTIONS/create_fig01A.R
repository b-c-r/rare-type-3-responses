# Description:
# The function creates Figure 1(A) from Kalinkat et al. (under review)
#
# Arguments:
# N:     The resource densities (positive vector)
# Fmax:  The maximum feeding rate (the curves' asymptote, single value)
# a:     The attack rate (single value)
# ylims: the limits of the y-axis
# output_path: the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "FIG_OUT/")
# save_output: Logical (T/F). Should the output be saved as pdf?
# 
# The default settings are as used in Kalinkat et al. (under review).
# 
# Requirements:
# None
# 
# References
# Kalinkat et al. (under review): Empirical evidence of type III functional responses and why it remains rare.
