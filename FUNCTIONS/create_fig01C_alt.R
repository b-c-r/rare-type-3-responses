# Description:
# The function creates Figure 1(C alternative) from Kalinkat et al. (under review)
#
# Arguments:
# N:           The resource densities (positive vector)
# Fmax:        The maximum feeding rate (the curves' asymptote, single value)
# N0:          The half saturation rate (density at which Fmax is reached, single value)
# ylims:       The limits of the y-axis
# Nlow:        Lower cutoff as often seen in lab experiments (Sarnelle and Wilson 2008)
# Nhigh:       Upper cuttof as often seen in field observations (Coblentz et al. 2022)
# output_path: The (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "FIG_OUT/")
# save_output: Logical (T/F). Should the output be saved as pdf?
# 
# The default settings are as used in Kalinkat et al. (under review).
# 
# Requirements:
# Calls the function calc_gen_fr()
#
