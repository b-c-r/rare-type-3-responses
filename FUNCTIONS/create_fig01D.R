# Description:
# The function creates Figure 1(D) from Kalinkat et al. (under review). The
# plot shows the behavior of the generalized or theta-sigmoid functional
# response (Real 1977; Okuyama and Ruyle 2011; Vucic‐Pestic et al. 2010).
#
# Arguments:
# N:     The resource densities (positive vector)
# Fmax:  The maximum feeding rate (the curves' asymptote, single value)
# N0:    The half saturation rate (density at which Fmax is reached, single value)
# Theta: The shaping exponent (can be a vector)
# ylims: the limits of the y-axis
# output_path: the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "FIG_OUT/")
# save_output: Logical (T/F). Should the output be saved as pdf?
# 
# The default settings are as used in Kalinkat et al. (under review).
# 
# Requirements:
# Calls the function calc_gen_fr()
