# Description:
# The function creates Figure 1(E) from Kalinkat et al. (under review)
#
# Arguments:
# B_in:        Bifurcation data for the basal species. The *.CSV name (default = "bifout_basal.csv")
# I_in:        Bifurcation data for the intermediate species. The *.CSV name (default = "bifout_intermediate.csv")
# T_in:        Bifurcation data for the top species. The *.CSV name (default = "bifout_top.csv")
# input_path:  the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "SIM_OUT/")
# output_path: the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "FIG_OUT/")
# save_output: Logical (T/F). Should the output be saved as pdf?
# 
# The default settings are as used in Kalinkat et al. (under review).
# 
# Requirements:
# Needs bifurcation data, eventually simulated with run_foodchain_sim_mt()
# 
# References
# Kalinkat et al. (under review): Empirical evidence of type III functional responses and why it remains rare.
