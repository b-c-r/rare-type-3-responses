# Description:
# The function simulates the 3-species food chain across a gradient of q values
# and saves the output as *.csv files for a bifurcation diagram. The food-chain
# model is based on Otto et al. (2007) with adaptions from Williams and Martinez
# (2004). See also the supplement information of Kalinkat et al. (under review)
# for details. The package odeintr (Keitt 2007) is required to run the function.
# This version of the function is a wrapper around run_foodchain_sim() to run
# the code in parallel.
#
# Arguments:
# qrange:      A vector with all q-values to be simulated (default = seq(0, .2, length = 501)
# ts_length:   The length of each time series to be simulated (default = 100000)
# steplength:  The explicit times steps that will be simulated (default = .5)
# analyze_ts:  The percentage of the time series that should be analyzed (e.g.
#              The last 5 %) (default = 0.05; between 0 and 1)
# unique_out:  Should double entries within one q value be deleted? (default = T),
# max_out:     Number of different extrema to be saved (default = 20; 0 == All are save),
# output_path: the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "SIM_OUT/")
# noC:         the number of threads that should be used for parallel computing (default to all possible threads)
# 
# Requirements:
# Compilation of the food chain model (run compile_foodchain())
# Needs the package odeintr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odeintr)
# Needs the package parallel
# Needs the package foreach (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach)
# Needs the package iterators (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iterators)
# Needs the package doParallel (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doParallel)
