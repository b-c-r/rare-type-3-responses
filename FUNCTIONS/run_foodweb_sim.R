# Description:
# The function simulates the 10-species food web across a gradient of q-values
# and saves the output as *.csv files. The foodweb model is based on Williams and
# Martinez (2004) paper with minor changes. See also Kalinkat et al. (2023) and 
# Rall et al. (2023) for details. The package odeintr (Keitt 2017) is required
# to run the function.
#
# Arguments:
# qrange:          a vector with all q-values to be simulated (default = seq(0, 4, length = 201)
# a:               the allometric constant (default = 0.2227; see Otto et al. 2007)
# b:               the allometric exponent (default = -0.25; see Otto et al. 2007)
# e:               the assimilation efficiency (default = 0.85; see Otto et al. 2007)
# y:               the relative maximum feeding rate (default = 8; see Otto et al. 2007)
# N0:              the half saturation rate (default = 0.5; see Otto et al. 2007)
# R:               the body mass ratio range a species can have (default = c(10, 100)). Must be a vector of 2 numbers!
# ts_runs:         the number of sequential simulation runs adding up to on time series (default = 10)
# ts_run_length:   the length of one separated simulation from all runs adding up to one time series (default = 500)
# steplength:      the explicit times steps that will be simulated (default = 1)
# output_path:     the (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "SIM_OUT/")
# output_filename: the name of the output file (default = "strong_interactions.csv")
# create_csv:      logical: should a csv be written to the hard-drive? (default = T)
# create_folder:   logical: should a new path be generated (default = T)
# 
# Requirements:
# Compilation of the foodweb model (run compile_foodweb())
# Needs the package odeintr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odeintr; Keitt 2017)
