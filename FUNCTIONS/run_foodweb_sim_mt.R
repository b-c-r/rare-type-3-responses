# Description:
# The function simulates the 10-species food web across a gradient of q-values
# and saves the output as *.csv files. The foodweb model is based on Williams and
# Martinez (2004) with minor changes. See also Kalinkat et al. (2023) and Rall
# et al. (2023) for details. The package odeintr (Keitt 2017) is required to run
# the function.
#
# Arguments:
# qrange:          A vector with all q-values to be simulated (default = seq(0, 4, length = 201)
# a:               The allometric constant (default = 0.2227; see Otto et al. 2007)
# b:               The allometric exponent (default = -0.25; see Otto et al. 2007)
# e:               The assimilation efficiency (default = 0.85; see Otto et al. 2007)
# y:               The relative maximum feeding rate (default = 8; see Otto et al. 2007)
# N0:              The half saturation rate (default = 0.5; see Otto et al. 2007)
# R:               The body mass ratio range a species can have (default = c(10, 100)). Must be a vector of 2 numbers!
# ts_runs:         The number of sequential simulation runs adding up to on time series (default = 10)
# ts_run_length:   The length of one separated simulation from all runs adding up to one time series (default = 500)
# steplength:      The explicit times steps that will be simulated (default = 1)
# output_path:     The (sub-)path were the output files should be saved to (default = "SIM_OUT/")
# output_filename: The name of the output file (default = "strong_interactions.csv")
# noC:             The number of threads that should be used (default to 3/4 of all possible threads)
#                  NOTE: if you want to run the code on a single core use the function run_foodweb_sim()
# 
# Requirements:
# Compilation of the foodweb model (run compile_foodweb()) and the function
# "run_foodchain_sim()" that is called here.
# Needs the package odeintr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odeintr, Keitt 2017)
# Needs the package parallel
# Needs the package foreach (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=foreach)
# Needs the package iterators (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iterators)
# Needs the package doParallel (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=doParallel)
