# Description:
# The function sets the parameter values for the compiled foodchain. See the
# description of the odeintr package (Keitt 2017) for details how to apply
# such functions. You need to execute compile_foodchain() first! See also the 
# description in compile_foodchain.R for the model. See Kalinkat et al. (2023),
# Rall et al. (2023), and references below for further description.
#
# Arguments:
# a:  the allometric constant (default = 0.2227; see Otto et al. 2007)
# b:  the allometric exponent (default = -0.25; see Otto et al. 2007)
# e:  the assimilation efficiency (default = 0.85; see Otto et al. 2007)
# y:  the relative maximum feeding rate (default = 8; see Otto et al. 2007)
# N0: the half saturation rate (default = 0.5; see Otto et al. 2007)
# q:  the shaping exponent (default = 0; see Williams and Martinez 2004)
# R:  the body mass ratio (default = 100; see Otto et al. 2007)
# 
# Requirements:
# Compilation of the food chain model (run compile_foodchain())
# Needs the package odeintr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=odeintr)
